# Sentiment-Analysis
I worked as a social marketing analyst in a consulting company to uncover the impacts of online advertising and communication with customers. The aim of the study is to educate the marketing teams of their clients (in diverse industries) to market their products and/or services on social media to maximise customersâ€™ involvement (positive interest and sharing). The company is interested in finding out the relationship between the keywords, comments, sentiments and whether there is a relationship in different topic categories such as entertainment, technology, sports, etc. that are of interest to different clients in variousindustries.
